# Project Repository

This repository contains various programming assignments and labs from different semesters and subjects. The code is written in multiple languages including Python, C, and Java.

## Structure

The repository is structured by semester and subject. Each subject has its own directory with relevant files.

### Semester 1

- **Matlab**: Contains Jupyter notebooks written in Python for Matlab assignments. Examples include Lhospitol.ipynb and minima-maxima.ipynb.
- **Python**: Contains Python scripts for Python Lab. An example is 7.py which backs up a given folder into a ZIP file.

### Semester 2

- **Matlab**: Contains Jupyter notebooks written in Python for Matlab assignments. Examples include Lab-4.ipynb and LabExam.ipynb.
- **C**: Contains C programs for C Lab. An example is q12.c which copies a text file to another.

### Semester 3

- **OS**: Contains C programs for OS Lab. Examples include 8A.c and 8B.c which simulate single level and two level directory file organization techniques respectively.
- **Java**: Contains Java programs for Java Lab. Examples include Buffer.java which reads a file and Lab5.java which demonstrates object-oriented programming.
